models/lnd/clm/tools/shared/mkmapgrids/README		Jun/04/2013

The routines in this directory create a grid map dataset in SCRIP format
that can be read by the mkmapdata utility to create mapping files for
mksurfdata_map. 

The deprecated FORTRAN program mkmapgrids can read in CLM fraction files in 
either the old CLM4.0.32 (CESM1.0.5) format or CAM file format.

There is also an NCL script that can create a SCRIP grid file for a regular
lat/lon grid. The script assumes that ALL data points are over land. So
a regional land grid, NOT a coastal region or a global grid.

See Also: See the models/lnd/clm/tools/README file for notes about setting
          the path for NetCDF and running the CLM tools.

Important files:

  mkscripgrid.ncl ----------- NCL script to create a SCRIP grid file for a regular lat/lon grid
                              (assumes ALL data is over land).
