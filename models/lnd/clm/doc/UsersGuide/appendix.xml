<title>Building the Users-Guide Documentation for &clm;</title>
<para>
All of the documentation for &clm; can be built using GNU Makefiles that are
available in the appropriate directories. The Makefiles require the following 
utilities: <command>docbook2html</command>, <command>docbook2pdf</command>, 
<command>protex</command>, and <command>latex2html</command>.
</para>
<para>
To build the Users Guide for &clm; (requires docbook).
<screen width="99">
> cd models/lnd/clm/doc/UsersGuide
> gmake
</screen>
Note, that when the Users-Guide is built it will get output from other &clm;
utilities that by nature abort, and hence stop the make from continuing. However,
this is expected so you should simply run <command>gmake</command> again until
it either completes or comes upon a legitimate issue. Here is what a sample
warning looks like when <command>gmake</command> is run.

The following line will fail in the make as it calls die -- but that is expected
Check that the output config_help.tlog is good and redo your make
../../bld/configure -help &gt;&amp;` config_help.tlog
make: *** [config_help.tlog] Error 255
</screen>
To build the Code Reference Guide for &clm; (requires <command>protex</command> and
<command>latex2html</command>). The make here uses a <filename>Filepath</filename>
file that points to the list of directories that you want <command>protex</command>
to run over. You should examine this file and make sure it is appropriate for what
you need to do, before running the make.
<screen width="99">
> cd models/lnd/clm/doc/CodeReference
> gmake
</screen>
To build the table of tests for the &clm; test suite. The make here runs a UNIX
shell script to create a html table of the list of tests run on the different machines
from the &clm; test suite.
<screen width="99">
> cd models/lnd/clm/test/system
> gmake
